    <h1>Invent Your Own Life: A Passage Through Time and Space</h1>
    <h2>By Elias Leon</h2>
    <p>This multi-media project follows my own inner story of navigating through life in the face of various adversities, experiences, and loss during transitional and tumultuous times, as I decide what I kind of life I am going to lead. The self-portrait is how I see myself at this time. The videos are intended to connect one with the cycle of life and the passage of time. The audio is a quote from a Bill Watterson speech and is intended to serve as a reminder to be true to oneself and do what makes you happy as figure it all out. <br><br>

      All you can do it invent your own life.
